So the Sphere model name and will be different wherever it's being used.
Also i may have changed the texture that it was supposed to be using. 
Changed a bunch of radius in the modelsAndScene file for more accurate display of physics.
Also changed the scale of the walls because the 

Functionality:
==============
The Keyboard callback has been changed a little bit. I didn't realize that i still had some lua stuff happening when pressing a few buttons so i commented those out.
Added the functionality for a button to switch between physics implementations.

The Main:
=========
I have added a second physics world for the "switching of the physics engines". As well as a second factory and initPhysics Function.


ModelUtilities::
Added a function to create a rigidbody and add it to theBulletPhysicsWorld and one for theCustomPhysicsWorld.
Added externs to the new physics world and factories.
Added the mass to the game object for use when swapping rigid bodies.


NONE of the important code has been changed. I am only using the interface types in my "Game" code.
